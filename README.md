17 light-years away lies Altair, a star in the Aquila constellation. Altair is the short-form transliteration of Al-Nisr Al-Ta'ir (النسر الطائر) or "The Flying Eagle"; a predator known for its excellent vision.

The Altair is an FPGA development board focused on image processing, specifically, stereoscopic depth calculation enabled by two MIPI camera connectors. The board implements XAPP894 since MIPI is not supported natively by Zynq 7000. The development board is built around the MYC-C7Z010_20 SOM. This board is also my graduation project/thesis for my Mechatronics Engineering degree.

I have created a YouTube series that talks about the design which can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/@hasanthesyrian_).
